Changes were made to our large introductory statistics course at the start of 2016 to place a greater emphasis on exploring modern data. In considering how to design the first lectures, we wanted activities that moved quickly, required active participation, were engaging, interesting and relevant, and inspired students about what was to come in the remainder of the course. 

The underlying principles applied when designing new material were:

* Increase **awareness** of what are data
* Stimulate **curiosity** about learning from data
* Build **confidence** in thinking critically about data 
* Demonstrate computational **exploration** of data
* Model honest and **personal** storytelling
