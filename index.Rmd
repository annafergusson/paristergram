This site were created to support the paper *Exploring modern data in a large introductory statistic course*, which was presented at ICOTS10 (Kyoto, Japan) by **Anna Fergusson** and **Liza Bolton**. This paper will be published on the [IASE website](https://iase-web.org/Conference_Proceedings.php) following the conference. 

**Paper abstract**:

>The amount, availability, diversity and complexity of modern data means that students now require
a wider range of data-related knowledge and skills. We present our initial attempts at increasing
student awareness of what can be learned from modern data, within the context of working with
large classes (n â‰ˆ 450) made up of students from diverse majors. Through the telling of data
exploration stories we cover: sourcing data through APIs, web scraping and open databases;
working with different types of data/variables such as text, timestamps, location co-ordinates and
images; and potential issues related to data quality, ownership, and privacy.

**Some helpful things**:

> [Data](data.html) provides more information about how the data was obtained.

> [Je t'aime Paris exploration](exploration.html) provides examples of how the data are currently used for teaching.

> [Newer explorations](new.html) provides ideas for further explorations with the data.

> [And then?](future.html) discusses where to next and presents one idea for introducing R-driven exploration.
